##Hotel Room Management System in C++

This is a C++ console application that demonstrates the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through a practical Room Booking System.

It is designed for beginners in C++ who want to understand classes, methods, loops, vectors, and menu-driven programs.

##Features
-Room Booking System

Add multiple rooms with room number, availability, and price.

Check if a room is available by its number.

Search rooms based on price.

Book a room and store basic booking info (name, phone, date).

Display all room information including number, price, and availability.

-Key Concepts Practiced

Classes and Objects: Organizing room data logically.

Encapsulation: Using private variables with public getters/methods.

Vectors: Managing dynamic lists of rooms.

Menu-driven Program: Looping and branching to interact with the user.

Conditional Logic: Decision-making for availability and booking.

User Input Handling: Asking users for input and validating it.

##How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-link>

2. Open the project in a C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, CLion) or compile with g++:

g++ main.cpp -o hotel_management
./hotel_management

3. Follow the console prompts to interact with the system.

##Future Improvements

Save bookings to a file for persistence.

Update room availability automatically after booking.

Add multiple users and booking history.

Implement a GUI for better user interaction.
